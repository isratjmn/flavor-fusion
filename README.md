* Create a navbar with the website name, Home, Blog, and User Profile Picture. If the user is not signed in, the navbar should show the Login button. If the user hovers over the profile picture, their name should appear.

* Design a footer that provides relevant information about the website, such as contact information or social media links. Ensure that the navbar and footer are present on all pages of the website.

* The login page should include options for email/password login, Google sign-in, and GitHub sign-in. Include a link to the registration page.

* The registration page should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and photo URL. Display errors if the email or password is incorrect, the password is less than 6 characters, or the email and password fields are empty.

* The homepage should have a banner section with a reasonable design that could include text, background images, or a slider. Add a Chef section with at least six cards that display the Chef's picture, name, years of experience, number of recipes, likes, and a View Recipes button.

* Display the chef's recipes in a tabular form or card group, with the recipe name, ingredients (at least 5), cooking method, rating, and a Favorite button. Show at least three recipes per chef, and allow users to mark recipes as favorites. Display a toast message when the user clicks the Favorite button and disable the button.

* Include a spinner to indicate when data is loading, and create a 404 page with a picture. Finally, use environment variables to hide the Firebase config keys, and add an "active route" indicator to show the user which page they are on.
